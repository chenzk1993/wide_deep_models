Wide and Deep Models


Are you able to predict the price of a certain wine bottle only from its description and region? Sincerely, I am not, but Machine learning can do it!
W firstly use an ordinary/sequential Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) using Keras API and afterwards, a specific architecture of ANNs, called "Wide and Deep" 
to predict the wine price based on its regions and description.
